## 1. Project Overview

### Application Purpose

A Progressive Web App designed for daily operational checklists in a business environment. Staff members complete department-specific opening and closing checklists, with real-time monitoring for managers and automated notification systems.

### Key Business Requirements

- Simple staff number authentication (no passwords)
- Department-based checklist assignment
- Time-based checklist visibility (Opening before 2pm, both after 2pm)
- Real-time progress monitoring for managers
- Automated notifications for incomplete checklists
- Offline capability with sync
- Mobile-first design optimized for touch interactions
- Multi-role support for flexible access control

### User Roles

The system supports users having multiple roles simultaneously:

- **User Role**: Complete daily checklists
- **Manager Role**: Monitor progress, receive notifications
- **Admin Role**: Create/manage checklist templates and departments

A single person can have any combination of these roles, providing flexibility for real-world organizational structures.

## 4. Database Schema & Supabase Configuration

### Core Tables Design

#### 4.1 Departments Table

This table stores department information used for checklist assignment and organizational structure. Each department has a unique code for easy identification and can be activated or deactivated as needed.

#### 4.2 Staff Table

The staff table contains basic user information without any role data. Each staff member is uniquely identified by their staff number. The table includes personal details like full name and email, along with an optional default department assignment. This separation of user data from role information allows for more flexible permission management.

#### 4.3 Roles Table

A reference table defining the available roles in the system. Initially populated with three core roles: admin, manager, and user. Each role has a unique name and description explaining its purpose. This table structure allows for easy addition of new roles in the future without modifying the core authentication logic.

#### 4.4 Staff Role Assignments Table

This junction table creates the many-to-many relationship between staff and roles. Each record represents one role assignment for a specific staff member. A single person can have multiple entries in this table, one for each role they possess. The table tracks who assigned each role and when, providing a complete audit trail of permission changes.

#### 4.5 Checklist Templates Table

Defines the structure of reusable checklists for each department. Templates are categorized as either opening or closing checklists. Each template includes deadline times and notification settings. Templates can be activated or deactivated without deletion, preserving historical data.

#### 4.6 Template Tasks Table

Contains the individual tasks that make up each checklist template. Tasks are ordered sequentially and can be marked as required or optional. Each task includes a title and optional description to guide staff members.

#### 4.7 Daily Checklist Instances Table

Represents actual checklist assignments for specific dates, implementing enterprise-grade audit trail requirements. Created automatically each day from active templates following the **recurring pattern storage** best practice model.

**Core Functionality:**

- Tracks current status (pending, in progress, completed, overdue) with immutable state transitions
- Records comprehensive timestamps for start, completion, and all status changes
- Links to both the source template (pattern) and assigned staff member (execution)
- Enables time-based business logic including the 2 PM visibility rule
- Provides foundation for compliance reporting and historical analysis

**Data Integrity Features:**

- Each instance represents a unique date + template + department combination
- Prevents duplicate generation through composite key constraints
- Maintains referential integrity to templates while allowing template modifications
- Supports flexible staff assignment without affecting template structure

This design enables **individual audit trails** essential for compliance while supporting the real-time monitoring requirements for managers. The separation between templates (what to do) and instances (what was actually done) follows enterprise best practices for operational checklist systems.

#### 4.8 Task Completions Table

Records individual task completions within checklist instances, providing **immutable audit trail capabilities** essential for enterprise compliance requirements.

**Audit Trail Features:**

- **Immutable Records**: Each completion is permanently recorded with cryptographic integrity
- **Complete Context**: Captures who completed each task, when, and under what circumstances
- **Compliance Tracking**: Supports regulatory requirements for operational procedure documentation
- **Historical Analysis**: Enables performance pattern analysis and training need identification

**Data Integrity Enforcement:**

- Ensures each task can only be marked complete once per checklist instance
- Maintains complete chain of custody from task assignment to completion
- Provides detailed tracking for compliance reporting and management oversight
- Links completion events to real-time notifications for managers

**Manager Dashboard Integration:**

- **Real-time Visibility**: Task completions trigger immediate dashboard updates
- **Progress Monitoring**: Managers see individual task completion times and patterns
- **Performance Analytics**: Historical completion data supports performance reviews
- **Summary Reports**: Aggregated data provides % completion, timing analysis, and compliance metrics

This table serves as the foundation for both compliance reporting and real-time operational monitoring, ensuring complete accountability while supporting efficient management oversight.

#### 4.9 Notifications Table

Logs all system notifications sent to users. Tracks notification type (email, push, in-app), recipient, content, and delivery status. Used for troubleshooting delivery issues and ensuring critical alerts reach their intended recipients.

### Row Level Security (RLS) Policies

The RLS implementation uses a flexible role-based access control system where users can have multiple roles simultaneously. Access is determined by checking if a user has any of the required roles for a specific action.

#### User Role Policies

Users with the 'user' role can view and complete checklists in their assigned department. They can mark tasks as complete for checklists assigned to them and view their own progress. They cannot access other departments' checklists or modify template structures.

#### Manager Role Policies

Users with the 'manager' role have expanded viewing permissions for all checklists in departments they oversee, with **comprehensive monitoring capabilities** designed for operational oversight.

**Real-time Monitoring Access:**

- **Progress Visibility**: View live completion status across all department checklists
- **Individual Task Tracking**: See which specific tasks have been completed and by whom
- **Timeline Analysis**: Access detailed completion timestamps for each task
- **Performance Metrics**: Monitor average completion times and identify bottlenecks

**Dashboard & Reporting Capabilities:**

- **Summary Statistics**: View overall % completion, tasks completed/not completed
- **Staff Performance Tracking**: Monitor who completed each checklist and completion times
- **Historical Trends**: Access completion patterns and compliance rates over time
- **Automated Alerts**: Receive notifications for overdue checklists and deadline approaches

**Operational Flexibility:**

- If they also have the 'user' role, managers can complete checklists themselves
- Can export detailed reports for upper management and compliance purposes
- Access to escalation workflows for managing incomplete checklists

This role provides the essential operational oversight needed for business continuity while maintaining appropriate access boundaries for different organizational levels.

#### Admin Role Policies

Users with the 'admin' role have full system access for configuration and management. They can create and modify checklist templates, manage departments, and assign roles to staff members. Admins can access system-wide reports and modify notification settings. They do not automatically inherit lower-level permissions unless explicitly assigned those roles.

### Database Functions & Triggers

#### Daily Checklist Generation

An automated process runs at midnight each day to create checklist instances from active templates. This approach follows enterprise best practices for recurring task systems, using a **recurring pattern storage** model where templates define the pattern and instances track execution.

**Architectural Justification:**

- **Compliance Requirements**: Individual instances provide complete audit trails required for regulatory compliance
- **Time-based Business Logic**: Daily instances enable the 2 PM visibility rule for closing checklists
- **Historical Data Tracking**: Preserves completion patterns, performance metrics, and compliance records over time
- **Flexible Assignment**: Assigns checklists to departments rather than specific users initially, allowing dynamic staff assignment

**Scale Analysis:**

- Current scope: 10 departments × 2 checklists = 20 daily instances (7,300 annually)
- Performance impact: Minimal with sophisticated indexing on date and department fields
- Storage efficiency: Normalized design prevents duplication while maintaining query performance

The function checks for existing instances to prevent duplicates and implements intelligent conflict resolution for edge cases. This design enables comprehensive audit trails while maintaining optimal performance for the expected scale.

#### Overdue Detection

A scheduled function runs every 30 minutes to identify incomplete checklists past their deadline. When overdue checklists are detected, the function updates their status and triggers the notification system. The frequency and timing of these checks can be adjusted based on business needs.

#### Role Validation Functions

Helper functions validate user roles for RLS policies and application logic. One function checks if a user has a specific role, while another returns all roles for a user. These functions are marked as SECURITY DEFINER to ensure they execute with appropriate permissions while maintaining security.

## 5. State Management Architecture

### Zustand Store Structure

#### 5.1 Auth Store

The authentication store manages user identity and role context throughout the application. It maintains the current user object, their complete list of assigned roles, and the currently selected department. The store provides computed properties for quick role checks, eliminating the need for repeated array searches throughout the application.

Key state elements include the authenticated user details, an array of all user roles, the selected department for the current session, and loading states for async operations. The store also tracks which role context the user is currently operating under when they have multiple roles.

Computed getters provide convenient methods to check role permissions. These include checking for a specific role, checking for any of multiple roles, and department access validation. These getters are memoized for performance and update automatically when the underlying role data changes.

Actions handle the complete authentication flow from staff number validation through role loading and department selection. The login action validates the staff number, creates the session, and loads all user roles. Department selection validates access based on user roles before allowing the switch.

#### 5.2 Checklist Store

Manages all checklist-related data and operations, including both cached and real-time data. The store maintains lists of available checklists based on time of day and user permissions, the currently active checklist being completed, and task completion states.

The store implements optimistic updates for task completion, immediately updating the UI while queueing the change for server sync. This provides responsive feedback even in poor network conditions. Failed updates are rolled back with appropriate error messaging.

Real-time subscriptions are managed through this store, with automatic cleanup on component unmount. The store subscribes to updates for the current department and checklist, ensuring all users see live progress updates.

Offline capabilities are built into the store's core operations. When offline, all actions are queued for later sync. The store maintains a local cache of checklist data in IndexedDB, allowing full functionality without network access.

#### 5.3 Role Store

A dedicated store for managing role-related UI state and operations. While the auth store maintains the user's roles, this store handles role switching, role-based UI adaptations, and permission calculations for complex scenarios.

The store tracks the currently active role for UI purposes, allowing users with multiple roles to switch contexts without re-authenticating. It maintains role-specific preferences like default views and notification settings.

Actions include role switching with appropriate UI updates, permission calculations for feature access, and role-based navigation helpers. The store integrates with the router to ensure users are directed to appropriate views based on their active role.

#### 5.4 Notification Store

Handles all notification-related state including in-app alerts, push notification subscriptions, and notification preferences. The store maintains a queue of notifications with read/unread status and provides methods for notification management.

Push notification state includes the subscription status, browser permission state, and VAPID keys. The store handles the complete push notification setup flow including permission requests and subscription management.

In-app notifications are stored with metadata including type, priority, and expiration. The store provides filtering and sorting capabilities for the notification center UI. Read receipts are tracked and synced with the server.

#### 5.5 Offline Store

Manages the offline state and synchronization queue for the application. This store is critical for PWA functionality, tracking network status and queuing actions for later execution.

The store maintains real-time network status using browser APIs and custom heartbeat checks. It queues all actions performed while offline, maintaining order and preventing duplicates. Each queued action includes metadata for retry logic and conflict resolution.

Sync operations are managed intelligently, with different strategies for different types of data. Checklist completions use last-write-wins, while task completions are merged to prevent data loss. The store provides progress feedback during sync operations.

### Store Patterns & Best Practices

#### Modern Zustand 5.x Patterns

```typescript
// Modern Zustand with immer for immutable updates
import { create } from 'zustand'
import { immer } from 'zustand/middleware/immer'
import { subscribeWithSelector } from 'zustand/middleware'
import { devtools } from 'zustand/middleware'

interface ChecklistState {
  checklists: Checklist[]
  tasks: Task[]
  completeTask: (taskId: string) => void
  updateProgress: () => void
}

const useChecklistStore = create<ChecklistState>()()
devtools(
  subscribeWithSelector(
    immer((set, get) => ({
      checklists: [],
      tasks: [],

      completeTask: (taskId: string) =>
        set((state) => {
          const task = state.tasks.find((t) => t.id === taskId)
          if (task) {
            task.completed = true
            task.completedAt = new Date().toISOString()
          }
        }),

      updateProgress: () => {
        // Atomic updates with immer
      },
    })),
  ),
)
```

#### React 19 Integration Patterns

```typescript
// Modern React 19 patterns with Suspense
import { use } from 'react'

const ChecklistData = ({ checklistId }: { checklistId: string }) => {
  // Use React 19's use() hook for data fetching
  const checklist = use(fetchChecklist(checklistId))

  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<ChecklistSkeleton />}>
      <ChecklistComponent checklist={checklist} />
    </Suspense>
  )
}
```

#### State Persistence

Critical state elements are persisted to localStorage with encryption for sensitive data. The persistence layer handles serialization of complex data types and provides migration strategies for schema changes. Session data is kept separate from persistent data for security.

#### Subscription Management

All real-time subscriptions are tracked centrally to prevent memory leaks. Subscriptions are automatically cleaned up when components unmount or when the user navigates away. The system implements exponential backoff for reconnection attempts.

#### Performance Optimization

Stores use computed properties extensively to prevent unnecessary recalculations. Selectors are memoized using shallow equality checks. Large lists implement virtualization through separate pagination stores. Updates are batched to prevent excessive re-renders.

## 6. User Authentication Flow

### 6.1 Staff Number Login Component

#### Features & Functionality

The staff number input component serves as the primary authentication interface. It provides a numeric-only input field optimized for mobile keyboards, automatically focusing on load and displaying the numeric keypad on mobile devices.

Input validation occurs in real-time, checking for proper format and length requirements. The component provides immediate feedback for invalid entries without waiting for form submission. Valid staff numbers follow a configurable pattern, typically 4-10 digits.

The component includes intelligent error handling with user-friendly messages. Instead of generic "invalid credentials" errors, it provides specific feedback like "Staff number must be 6 digits" or "Staff number not found in system".

Loading states are carefully managed to prevent multiple submissions. A progress indicator appears during validation, and the input is disabled to prevent changes. The component maintains focus management for accessibility.

Optional features include remembering the last successful login (stored securely) and auto-formatting input with visual separators for longer staff numbers. The component also handles paste events, stripping non-numeric characters automatically.

#### UI Considerations

Touch targets meet accessibility standards with a minimum 48px height. The input field uses large, readable fonts with high contrast ratios. Error messages appear below the input with appropriate ARIA labels for screen readers.

Visual feedback includes border color changes for validation states, subtle animations for error messages, and a success indicator before navigation. The component follows mobile-first design principles with appropriate spacing for thumb reach.

### 6.2 Department Selection Component

#### Features & Functionality

The department selector presents available departments based on user permissions. For users with access to multiple departments, it displays all options in an organized grid or list layout. The component fetches department data on mount, showing a skeleton loader during the fetch.

Each department card displays the department name prominently with optional additional metadata like number of active checklists or staff count. Visual indicators show if a department has pending tasks or requires immediate attention.

Search and filter capabilities allow quick department location in organizations with many departments. The search is performed client-side for immediate results, with fuzzy matching for user convenience.

Selection handling includes visual confirmation of the selected department before proceeding. The component can optionally remember the last selected department per user, though this is cleared daily to ensure proper department assignment.

For users assigned to a single department, the component can auto-select and proceed, showing a brief confirmation message. This streamlines the process for users who always work in the same department.

#### UI Considerations

The layout adapts between grid and list views based on screen size and department count. On mobile devices, departments are displayed in a single column with large tap targets. On tablets and desktop, a responsive grid maximizes screen usage.

Each department card uses consistent styling with clear boundaries and adequate padding. Selected states are visually distinct using border highlights, background colors, or elevation changes. Loading states preserve layout to prevent content shifting.

Accessibility features include keyboard navigation between departments, clear focus indicators, and proper ARIA labels. The component announces selection changes to screen readers and provides context about the selection's purpose.

### 6.3 Role Selection Component

#### Features & Functionality

For users with multiple roles, the role selector appears after department selection (or after login for single-department users). It presents available roles with clear descriptions of each role's capabilities and typical use cases.

The component explains the impact of role selection on the user interface and available features. For example, selecting "Manager" role explains that they'll see monitoring dashboards, while "User" role leads to checklist completion interfaces.

Role cards include visual indicators like icons or colors associated with each role. The component can show additional context like "You last used Manager role yesterday" to help users make quick decisions.

Quick-switch options allow users to change roles later without logging out, though this is presented carefully to avoid confusion. The selected role persists for the session but can be changed through a dropdown or menu option.

For users with a single role, this step is skipped entirely, with automatic role assignment and appropriate navigation. The system logs role selection for audit purposes and analytics about role usage patterns.

#### UI Considerations

Role selection uses a card-based layout similar to department selection for consistency. Cards are sized appropriately for the amount of content, with consistent heights maintained through flexbox layouts.

Visual hierarchy emphasizes role names while keeping descriptions readable but secondary. Icons or illustrations help users quickly identify roles, especially helpful for users who switch roles frequently.

The component includes a "Remember my choice" option for users who typically use the same role. This preference is stored securely and can be cleared through user settings. Loading and transition states maintain visual continuity with the rest of the authentication flow.

### 6.4 Authentication Service Architecture

#### Implementation Strategy

The authentication service orchestrates the entire login flow, managing state transitions and error handling throughout the process. It implements a custom Supabase RPC function for staff number validation, avoiding the need for traditional username/password authentication.

Staff number validation occurs server-side to prevent client-side bypass attempts. The RPC function checks the staff number against the database, returning user details and assigned roles if valid. Rate limiting prevents brute force attempts.

Role loading happens immediately after successful authentication. The service fetches all assigned roles for the user, caching them for the session duration. This prevents repeated database queries for permission checks throughout the application.

Session management uses Supabase's built-in auth system with custom claims for role information. The service generates a system password behind the scenes, invisible to users but satisfying Supabase's authentication requirements. Tokens are refreshed automatically before expiration.

Department validation ensures users can only select departments they have access to. For users with manager or admin roles, this might include multiple departments. For regular users, it's typically limited to their assigned department.

#### Security Measures

Rate limiting is implemented at multiple levels, including the CDN, Supabase, and application layers. Failed login attempts are tracked per IP and per staff number, with exponential backoff for repeated failures.

Session tokens use secure, httpOnly cookies where possible, with fallback to secure localStorage for mobile PWA requirements. Token rotation occurs on each successful authentication to prevent session fixation attacks.

All authentication-related communications use HTTPS with certificate pinning in the mobile PWA. The service implements CSRF protection for state-changing operations and validates all inputs server-side.

Audit logging captures all authentication events including successful logins, failed attempts, role switches, and logouts. These logs are retained according to compliance requirements and are accessible to administrators for security monitoring.

## 7. Component Architecture

### 7.1 Checklist Overview Page

#### ChecklistCard Component

The ChecklistCard serves as the primary interaction point for users to access their daily checklists. Each card represents either an opening or closing checklist, with clear visual distinction between the two types.

Visual design emphasizes the checklist type through color coding, with opening checklists using morning-themed colors (blues, yellows) and closing checklists using evening themes (oranges, purples). Icons reinforce this distinction, using sun imagery for opening and moon for closing.

The card displays essential information including checklist title, number of tasks, completion progress, and deadline time. Progress visualization uses a prominent progress bar or circular indicator, showing percentage complete with color changes as deadlines approach.

Time-based visibility logic controls when cards appear. Opening checklists are always visible, while closing checklists only appear after 2 PM. This logic accounts for timezone considerations and adjusts for daylight saving time automatically.

Interactive states include hover effects on desktop and touch feedback on mobile. Tapping a card triggers a subtle animation before navigation. Loading states show skeleton cards to maintain layout stability during data fetches.

The completion status badge appears prominently when a checklist is finished, using a checkmark icon and success colors. Completed cards remain visible but are visually de-emphasized to focus attention on remaining tasks.

#### Features & Interactions

Auto-refresh functionality ensures the checklist view updates at the 2 PM boundary without user intervention. The component sets a timer for the exact transition time, smoothly animating in the closing checklist card when it becomes available.

Pull-to-refresh is implemented for mobile devices, allowing manual data refresh with visual feedback. The gesture triggers a complete data reload, updating both checklist availability and completion status. Haptic feedback enhances the interaction on supported devices.

The offline indicator appears as an unobtrusive banner when network connectivity is lost. It explains that changes will be saved locally and synced when connection returns. The indicator includes a manual sync button for user control.

Empty states handle various scenarios including no checklists assigned, all checklists completed, and outside of operating hours. Each empty state provides appropriate messaging and actions, such as contacting a supervisor if no checklists are available.

Accessibility features include proper heading hierarchy, ARIA labels for progress indicators, and keyboard navigation support. Screen readers announce checklist status and progress updates. Focus management ensures logical tab order through cards.

### 7.2 Checklist Detail Page

#### TaskItem Component

The TaskItem component represents individual tasks within a checklist, optimized for quick interaction on mobile devices. Each item displays the task title prominently with optional description text below in smaller, secondary typography.

The checkbox interaction area extends beyond the visual checkbox for easier touch targeting. The entire row is tappable, with visual feedback indicating the tappable area. Checkbox states include unchecked, checked, and loading (during sync).

Required tasks are indicated with a subtle badge or asterisk, with tooltip explanations on hover. Optional tasks use different styling to indicate their non-critical nature. Completed tasks show a strikethrough effect with reduced opacity.

Animation provides satisfying feedback for task completion. A checkmark animates in while the task text fades slightly. For offline completions, a sync indicator appears briefly. Failed syncs show an error state with retry options.

Long task descriptions are truncated by default with a "show more" option. This maintains consistent item heights while allowing detailed instructions when needed. The expansion animation is smooth and doesn't disrupt scrolling position.

#### TaskList Container

The TaskList container manages the collection of tasks, providing organization and progress tracking. Tasks can be grouped by category if the template defines sections, with collapsible headers for each group.

Progress visualization appears as a sticky header showing overall completion percentage and counts. The progress bar fills as tasks are completed, with color transitions at milestone percentages (50%, 75%, 100%).

Scroll position persistence ensures users return to their last position when navigating back from other screens. The component saves scroll position in session storage, restoring it smoothly without jarring jumps.

Keyboard navigation supports efficiency for desktop users. Tab moves between tasks, space toggles completion, and arrow keys navigate through the list. Focus indicators are clear and follow accessibility guidelines.

Bulk actions are available through a selection mode, allowing users to complete multiple tasks at once. This is particularly useful for routine tasks that are always done together. The interface prevents accidentally marking all tasks complete.

#### Completion Flow

The completion dialog appears when all required tasks are finished. It summarizes the completed checklist with timestamps and completion percentage. Users must explicitly confirm completion to prevent accidental submissions.

Success feedback includes a full-screen animation celebrating checklist completion. The animation is brief but satisfying, using the department or company branding colors. Haptic feedback on mobile devices enhances the moment.

Auto-navigation returns users to the overview page after a brief delay, allowing them to see their accomplishment. The navigation is cancelable if users need to review their work. The completed checklist card shows updated status immediately.

Sync status communication is clear throughout the process. During online completion, a simple success message appears. For offline completions, the UI explains that data is queued for sync with an estimated sync time.

Partial completion handling allows users to save progress and return later. The system tracks which user completed which tasks, important for compliance and accountability. Reopening a partial checklist shows previous progress clearly.

### 7.3 Manager Dashboard

#### ProgressMonitor Component

The ProgressMonitor provides real-time visibility into checklist completion across the department. It displays aggregate statistics including total checklists, completion percentage, and average time to complete.

Live updates occur through WebSocket connections, with new completions animating into view. Progress bars update smoothly as tasks are completed, providing satisfying visual feedback for managers monitoring their team.

Department filtering allows managers overseeing multiple departments to focus on specific areas. Filters persist between sessions and can be saved as presets. Quick filter buttons provide one-tap access to common views.

Time-based views show progress throughout the day, with historical comparison options. Managers can see if today's completion rate is above or below average, with trends visualized through sparkline charts.

Alert thresholds highlight checklists approaching deadlines without completion. Visual indicators escalate from yellow warnings to red alerts as deadlines pass. Customizable thresholds allow different urgency levels for different checklist types.

#### StaffProgressCard Component

Individual staff progress is displayed through compact cards showing name, assigned checklists, and completion status. Profile pictures or initials provide quick visual identification in large teams.

Real-time status updates show current activity, such as "Currently completing opening checklist" or "Last active 5 minutes ago". This helps managers understand who might need assistance without being intrusive.

Detailed views are accessible by tapping a staff card, showing individual task completion times and patterns. This data helps identify training needs or process improvements. Historical data is available for performance reviews.

Communication shortcuts allow managers to send quick messages or notifications to staff members. Pre-written templates for common situations speed up communication. All communications are logged for compliance.

Performance indicators highlight exceptional performance (fast completion times) or areas of concern (repeated late completions). These indicators use relative metrics to account for checklist complexity differences.

### 7.4 Admin Management

#### TemplateEditor Component

The template editor provides a comprehensive interface for creating and modifying checklist templates. The drag-and-drop interface allows easy task reordering with clear visual feedback during dragging operations.

Task property editing includes inline editing for quick changes and a detailed edit modal for complex modifications. Properties include title, description, required status, estimated time, and help text. Rich text editing is available for descriptions.

Preview functionality shows how the checklist will appear to end users, including mobile and desktop views. Admins can test the checklist flow without affecting live data. Preview mode includes completion time estimation.

Version history tracking shows all changes made to templates with timestamps and change authors. Admins can compare versions and revert if needed. Major changes can include notes explaining the reasoning.

Bulk operations allow efficient management of large checklists. Operations include marking multiple tasks as required/optional, reordering groups of tasks, and copying tasks between templates. Undo functionality prevents accidental changes.

Template cloning speeds up creation of similar checklists for different departments. Cloned templates can be modified independently. Cross-department standardization is supported through shared template libraries.

#### DepartmentManager Component

Department management encompasses creation, modification, and deactivation of departments. The interface displays all departments in a searchable, sortable table with quick actions for common operations.

Staff assignment interfaces show current department members with their roles. Bulk assignment tools allow moving multiple staff members between departments efficiently. Visual indicators show staff with multiple department assignments.

Activation controls allow temporary department deactivation without data loss. Deactivated departments are hidden from regular users but remain accessible to admins. Reactivation restores all settings and assignments.

Usage analytics show department-level statistics including average completion times, compliance rates, and peak activity periods. This data informs decisions about staffing and process improvements. Exportable reports support management presentations.

Integration settings connect departments with external systems like scheduling software or HR systems. API keys and webhooks are configured per department. Test modes allow verification without affecting production data.

## 8. Mobile-First PWA Implementation

### 8.1 Mobile-First Architecture Principles

The application follows strict mobile-first design principles, ensuring optimal performance and user experience on touch devices while maintaining functionality across all screen sizes.

#### Touch-First Interaction Design

- **Minimum Touch Targets**: All interactive elements meet the 44px minimum touch target size recommended by Apple and Google
- **Touch Gestures**: Native-like swipe gestures for task completion, navigation, and actions
- **One-Handed Operation**: Bottom navigation and floating action buttons enable single-handed use
- **Visual Feedback**: Immediate visual response to touch interactions with scale and haptic feedback

#### Progressive Enhancement Strategy

```typescript
// Mobile-first component pattern
const ChecklistCard = ({ checklist }) => {
  return (
    <div className="
      // Mobile-first (default)
      p-4 bg-white rounded-lg shadow-sm space-y-2
      // Tablet enhancement
      sm:p-6 sm:space-y-3
      // Desktop enhancement
      lg:flex lg:items-center lg:justify-between lg:space-y-0
    ">
      <h3 className="text-lg font-medium lg:text-xl">
        {checklist.name}
      </h3>
      <div className="flex gap-2 lg:gap-4">
        {/* Touch-optimized action buttons */}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

#### Responsive Breakpoint Strategy

- **xs (475px)**: Extra small phones
- **sm (640px)**: Small tablets, large phones
- **md (768px)**: Medium tablets
- **lg (1024px)**: Small laptops, large tablets
- **xl (1280px)**: Desktop displays
- **2xl (1536px)**: Large desktop displays

#### Performance Targets (2024 Enterprise Standards)

- **First Contentful Paint (FCP)**: < 0.8s on 3G networks
- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**: < 1.2s on mobile devices
- **Interaction to Next Paint (INP)**: < 100ms (replacing FID)
- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**: < 0.05 for stable mobile layouts
- **Time to First Byte (TTFB)**: < 400ms for API responses
- **Bundle Size**: < 150KB initial JavaScript bundle
- **JavaScript Boot Time**: < 600ms on mid-tier mobile devices
- **Route Transition**: < 100ms for navigation changes

### 8.2 Manifest Configuration

The web app manifest defines how the application appears and behaves when installed as a PWA. The configuration carefully balances functionality with user experience across different devices and platforms.

Display mode is set to "standalone" to provide an app-like experience without browser chrome. This removes the URL bar and navigation buttons, making the PWA feel like a native application. Fallback modes ensure graceful degradation on unsupported browsers.

The color scheme uses the company's branding colors for theme_color and background_color. Theme color affects the status bar on mobile devices, while background color appears during app launch. These colors are chosen for optimal contrast and visibility.

Icons are provided in multiple sizes to support various devices and contexts. Each icon is optimized for its specific use case, from small notification badges to large splash screen images. Maskable icons ensure proper display on Android's adaptive icon system.

App shortcuts provide quick access to common tasks directly from the app icon. Shortcuts might include "Start Opening Checklist" or "View Dashboard" for managers. These shortcuts are configured based on user roles when possible.

### 8.2 Service Worker Strategy

The service worker implements sophisticated caching strategies optimized for the checklist application's specific needs. Different resource types use different caching strategies for optimal performance and reliability.

App shell resources use a cache-first strategy with immediate activation. This includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and core images. These resources are precached during installation and updated in the background to minimize user disruption.

API responses use a network-first strategy with timeout fallback to cache. This ensures fresh data when online while providing offline functionality. The timeout is set to 3 seconds, balancing freshness with responsiveness on slow connections.

Static assets like icons and fonts use cache-first with background refresh. Once cached, these resources load instantly while updates download silently. Versioning ensures cache busting when resources change.

The offline page provides a branded experience when users are offline and request uncached resources. It includes helpful messaging about offline functionality and a manual refresh button. The page is optimized for minimal size and precached during installation.

Background sync handles offline task completions and other state changes. Failed requests are queued and retried when connectivity returns. The sync process includes intelligent retry logic with exponential backoff.

### 8.3 Installation Flow

The installation prompt appears contextually based on user engagement metrics. Rather than showing immediately, the prompt waits until users have completed at least one checklist or spent significant time in the app.

Custom installation UI replaces the browser's default prompt with branded messaging. The prompt explains PWA benefits specific to the checklist use case, such as offline access and push notifications. Platform-specific instructions guide users through installation.

Post-installation experience includes a welcome screen highlighting PWA features. Users are guided through enabling notifications and understanding offline capabilities. The onboarding can be skipped but is accessible later from settings.

Installation metrics track acceptance rates and user behavior post-installation. This data informs decisions about prompt timing and messaging. A/B testing optimizes installation rates while respecting user choice.

### 8.4 Update Strategy

The update process balances the need for fresh code with user experience. Updates download in the background without interrupting active sessions. Users are notified of available updates with non-intrusive messaging.

Version checking occurs on app focus and at regular intervals. The service worker compares cached version numbers with the server's latest version. Major updates may force immediate refresh for security or breaking changes.

Update prompts appear at natural transition points, such as after completing a checklist. This minimizes disruption to user workflows. The prompt includes brief release notes for significant features or fixes.

Rollback capabilities exist for critical issues. The service worker can revert to a previous version if the new version fails health checks. This ensures business continuity even during problematic deployments.

### 8.5 Mobile Navigation Architecture

#### Bottom Navigation Pattern

The primary navigation uses a fixed bottom bar optimized for thumb reach on modern smartphones:

```typescript
// Bottom navigation with role-based items
const BottomNav = () => {
  const { userRole } = useAuth();

  const getNavItems = () => {
    const baseItems = [
      { icon: HomeIcon, label: 'Home', path: '/' },
      { icon: ClipboardListIcon, label: 'Checklists', path: '/checklists' }
    ];

    if (userRole === 'manager') {
      baseItems.push(
        { icon: ChartBarIcon, label: 'Reports', path: '/reports' },
        { icon: UsersIcon, label: 'Team', path: '/team' }
      );
    }

    baseItems.push({ icon: UserIcon, label: 'Profile', path: '/profile' });
    return baseItems;
  };

  return (
    <nav className="fixed bottom-0 left-0 right-0 bg-white border-t pb-safe-bottom">
      <div className="flex justify-around">
        {getNavItems().map(item => (
          <NavButton key={item.path} {...item} />
        ))}
      </div>
    </nav>
  );
};
```

#### Drawer Navigation for Secondary Actions

A slide-in drawer handles settings, help, and less frequent actions:

```typescript
// Gesture-controlled navigation drawer
const DrawerMenu = ({ isOpen, onClose }) => {
  const bind = useSwipeGesture(
    () => onClose(), // Swipe left to close
    null
  );

  return (
    <Transition show={isOpen}>
      <Dialog onClose={onClose}>
        <div className="fixed inset-0 bg-black bg-opacity-50" />
        <div className="fixed inset-y-0 left-0 max-w-xs w-full">
          <Transition.Child
            enter="transform transition ease-in-out duration-300"
            enterFrom="-translate-x-full"
            enterTo="translate-x-0"
          >
            <div {...bind()} className="bg-white h-full shadow-xl">
              {/* Drawer content with touch-friendly menu items */}
            </div>
          </Transition.Child>
        </div>
      </Dialog>
    </Transition>
  );
};
```

### 8.6 Modern Web Platform APIs

#### Visual Viewport API for Mobile Keyboard Handling

```typescript
// Modern mobile keyboard handling
const useVisualViewport = () => {
  const [viewportHeight, setViewportHeight] = useState(window.innerHeight)
  const [isKeyboardOpen, setIsKeyboardOpen] = useState(false)

  useEffect(() => {
    if ('visualViewport' in window) {
      const handleViewportChange = () => {
        const currentHeight = window.visualViewport.height
        setViewportHeight(currentHeight)
        setIsKeyboardOpen(currentHeight < window.innerHeight * 0.8)
      }

      window.visualViewport.addEventListener('resize', handleViewportChange)
      return () => {
        window.visualViewport.removeEventListener(
          'resize',
          handleViewportChange,
        )
      }
    }
  }, [])

  return { viewportHeight, isKeyboardOpen }
}
```

#### Screen Wake Lock API for Checklist Completion

```typescript
// Prevent screen sleep during checklist completion
const useWakeLock = () => {
  const [wakeLock, setWakeLock] = useState<WakeLockSentinel | null>(null)

  const requestWakeLock = async () => {
    if ('wakeLock' in navigator) {
      try {
        const lock = await navigator.wakeLock.request('screen')
        setWakeLock(lock)

        lock.addEventListener('release', () => {
          setWakeLock(null)
        })
      } catch (err) {
        console.error('Wake lock request failed:', err)
      }
    }
  }

  const releaseWakeLock = () => {
    if (wakeLock) {
      wakeLock.release()
      setWakeLock(null)
    }
  }

  return { requestWakeLock, releaseWakeLock, isActive: !!wakeLock }
}
```

#### Web Share API for Report Sharing

```typescript
// Modern sharing for reports and checklists
const useWebShare = () => {
  const shareSupported = 'share' in navigator

  const shareReport = async (reportData: ReportData) => {
    if (shareSupported) {
      try {
        await navigator.share({
          title: `Checklist Report - ${reportData.department}`,
          text: `Completion report for ${reportData.date}`,
          url: generateReportUrl(reportData.id),
        })
      } catch (err) {
        // Fallback to clipboard or download
        fallbackShare(reportData)
      }
    } else {
      fallbackShare(reportData)
    }
  }

  return { shareReport, shareSupported }
}
```

#### View Transitions API for Smooth Navigation

```typescript
// Modern page transitions
const useViewTransitions = () => {
  const transitionSupported = 'startViewTransition' in document

  const transitionTo = (callback: () => void) => {
    if (transitionSupported) {
      document.startViewTransition(callback)
    } else {
      callback()
    }
  }

  return { transitionTo, transitionSupported }
}

// CSS for smooth transitions
/*
::view-transition-old(root),
::view-transition-new(root) {
  animation-duration: 0.3s;
}

::view-transition-old(checklist-card) {
  animation: slide-out 0.3s ease-in forwards;
}

::view-transition-new(checklist-card) {
  animation: slide-in 0.3s ease-out forwards;
}
*/
```

#### Origin Private File System API for Large Offline Data

```typescript
// Enhanced offline storage for large datasets
const usePrivateFileSystem = () => {
  const [opfsSupported] = useState('getDirectory' in navigator.storage)

  const storeOfflineData = async (data: LargeDataset) => {
    if (opfsSupported) {
      try {
        const opfsRoot = await navigator.storage.getDirectory()
        const fileHandle = await opfsRoot.getFileHandle('offline-data.json', {
          create: true,
        })

        const writable = await fileHandle.createWritable()
        await writable.write(JSON.stringify(data))
        await writable.close()
      } catch (err) {
        // Fallback to IndexedDB
        await fallbackToIndexedDB(data)
      }
    } else {
      await fallbackToIndexedDB(data)
    }
  }

  return { storeOfflineData, opfsSupported }
}
```

### 8.7 Touch Interaction Patterns

#### Swipe Gestures for Task Management

Tasks support intuitive swipe gestures for common actions:

```typescript
// Swipe-enabled task item
const TaskItem = ({ task, onComplete, onEdit }) => {
  const bind = useSwipeGesture(
    () => onComplete(task.id),  // Swipe right to complete
    () => onEdit(task.id)       // Swipe left to edit
  );

  return (
    <div
      {...bind()}
      className="
        relative py-4 px-4 bg-white border-b
        touch-pan-y // Allow vertical scrolling
        active:bg-gray-50 transition-colors
      "
      style={{ touchAction: 'pan-y' }}
    >
      <div className="flex items-center space-x-3">
        <TouchCheckbox
          checked={task.completed}
          onChange={() => onComplete(task.id)}
        />
        <span className={`flex-1 ${task.completed ? 'line-through text-gray-500' : ''}`}>
          {task.title}
        </span>
      </div>

      {/* Visual swipe indicators */}
      <div className="absolute inset-y-0 right-0 flex items-center pr-4 opacity-0 swipe-indicator">
        <CheckIcon className="h-6 w-6 text-green-500" />
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

#### Pull-to-Refresh Implementation

Native-like pull-to-refresh for checklist updates:

```typescript
// Pull-to-refresh hook
const usePullToRefresh = (onRefresh) => {
  const [isPulling, setIsPulling] = useState(false)
  const [pullDistance, setPullDistance] = useState(0)

  const bind = useGesture({
    onDrag: ({ movement: [, my], velocity: [, vy], direction: [, dy] }) => {
      if (dy > 0 && window.scrollY === 0) {
        setIsPulling(true)
        setPullDistance(Math.min(my, 80))

        if (my > 60 && vy > 0.5) {
          onRefresh()
        }
      }
    },
    onDragEnd: () => {
      setIsPulling(false)
      setPullDistance(0)
    },
  })

  return { bind, isPulling, pullDistance }
}
```

#### Touch-Optimized Form Controls

All form inputs are sized and spaced for comfortable touch interaction:

```typescript
// Touch-friendly form components
const TouchInput = ({ label, ...props }) => (
  <div className="space-y-2">

## 9. Real-Time Features

### 9.1 WebSocket Management

WebSocket connections are managed centrally to optimize resource usage and provide consistent behavior across the application. A singleton connection manager handles all WebSocket lifecycle events.

Connection establishment includes authentication token passing and connection quality detection. The initial handshake determines optimal settings like heartbeat frequency and batch sizes based on network conditions.

Reconnection logic implements exponential backoff with jitter to prevent thundering herd problems. Maximum retry attempts and timeout values are configurable. Connection state is exposed to UI components for user feedback.

Heartbeat monitoring ensures connection liveness with automatic reconnection on failure. Heartbeat frequency adapts based on network stability, reducing overhead on reliable connections while increasing monitoring on unstable ones.

Channel subscription management prevents duplicate subscriptions and ensures proper cleanup. A subscription registry tracks all active subscriptions with reference counting. Components can safely subscribe multiple times without creating duplicate connections.

### 9.2 Real-Time Updates

Progress updates flow from task completions to all relevant subscribers in real-time. Updates are batched on the server side to reduce message frequency while maintaining responsiveness. Typical latency is under 100ms on good connections.

Presence tracking shows which users are actively working on checklists. This helps managers see real-time activity without being invasive. Presence states include active, idle, and offline with configurable timeout thresholds.

Conflict resolution handles simultaneous updates gracefully. When multiple users complete the same task, the first completion wins with appropriate messaging to other users. The UI updates optimistically but reconciles with server state.

Data synchronization ensures all clients maintain consistent state. Full state refreshes occur periodically and after reconnection. Incremental updates reduce bandwidth usage during normal operation.

Performance optimization includes message deduplication, compression, and selective subscription. Clients only subscribe to relevant data based on user role and current view. Messages are compressed using MessagePack for efficiency.

### 9.3 Manager Dashboard Real-Time Features

Live progress visualization shows checklist completion as it happens. Progress bars animate smoothly as tasks are completed. Completion events trigger subtle notifications to draw manager attention without being disruptive.

Activity feeds display recent actions in chronological order. Each event includes timestamp, user, action type, and relevant details. The feed is filterable by department, user, or checklist type. Historical events are loaded on demand.

Alert generation happens in real-time as thresholds are crossed. Alerts for approaching deadlines, overdue checklists, or unusual patterns appear immediately. Alert preferences are customizable per manager with quiet hours support.

Team presence indicators show who's currently active in the system. Managers can see at a glance which team members are working on checklists. This helps with real-time support and workload distribution decisions.

Performance metrics update continuously throughout the day. Average completion times, compliance rates, and other KPIs reflect current state. Trend indicators show whether metrics are improving or declining compared to historical averages.

## 10. Notification System

### 10.1 In-App Notifications

The in-app notification system provides timely alerts without requiring external permissions or setup. Notifications appear as toast messages for immediate alerts and accumulate in a notification center for later review.

Toast notifications slide in from the top or bottom of the screen with appropriate styling for their type (info, warning, error, success). They include action buttons for quick responses and auto-dismiss after a configurable timeout.

The notification center is accessible via a bell icon in the header, showing unread count as a badge. The center groups notifications by type and date, with bulk actions for marking as read or clearing old notifications.

Priority levels determine notification behavior, from subtle informational messages to attention-grabbing alerts for critical issues. High-priority notifications may include sound effects or vibration on supported devices.

Persistence logic saves notifications to the database for cross-device synchronization. Users see consistent notification state regardless of which device they use. Read status syncs in real-time.

### 10.2 Push Notifications

Push notification implementation follows PWA best practices with progressive enhancement. The system works without push notifications but provides enhanced functionality when available.

Permission requests are timed thoughtfully, appearing after users have experienced value from the app. The request explains specific benefits like deadline reminders and manager alerts. Denied permissions are respected with alternative notification methods.

Subscription management handles the complex flow of VAPID keys, service worker registration, and subscription endpoints. Failed subscriptions fall back gracefully to in-app only notifications. Subscription status is clearly communicated to users.

Notification payload design balances information density with platform limitations. Titles are concise but descriptive. Body text includes essential details. Action buttons provide quick responses without opening the app.

Click handling routes users to relevant app sections based on notification type. Deep linking ensures users land on the specific checklist or dashboard view related to the notification. The app handles both foreground and background notification clicks.

### 10.3 Email Notifications

Email notifications complement push notifications for critical alerts and summary reports. The email system uses Supabase Edge Functions with the Resend API for reliable delivery.

Template design follows responsive email best practices with clear branding and mobile optimization. Templates exist for deadline reminders, overdue alerts, daily summaries, and weekly reports. Dynamic content is populated server-side.

Delivery scheduling respects user preferences and time zones. Daily summaries arrive at configured times. Urgent alerts send immediately. Batch processing prevents email floods during busy periods.

Unsubscribe handling provides granular control over notification types. Users can opt out of specific categories while maintaining others. Unsubscribe links are one-click with no additional confirmation required.

Analytics tracking monitors delivery rates, open rates, and click-through rates. This data informs template optimization and delivery timing. Bounce handling automatically disables email for invalid addresses.

### 10.4 Manager Alert System

Manager notifications require special handling due to their critical nature for business operations. Multiple notification channels ensure alerts reach managers even if one channel fails.

Escalation paths define how alerts propagate when not acknowledged. Initial alerts go to direct managers. Unacknowledged alerts escalate to senior managers after configured timeouts. Escalation chains are customizable per department.

Alert aggregation prevents notification fatigue by grouping related alerts. Multiple overdue checklists from the same department combine into a single alert with details. Aggregation rules are sophisticated enough to maintain urgency while reducing noise.

Quiet hours allow managers to define when they should not receive non-critical notifications. Critical alerts always send but use less intrusive delivery methods during quiet hours. Weekend and holiday rules provide additional flexibility.

Alert history provides audit trails for compliance and process improvement. All alerts are logged with delivery confirmation, acknowledgment status, and any actions taken. Reports show alert patterns and response times.

## 11. Mobile-First Offline Functionality

### 11.1 Mobile-Optimized IndexedDB Architecture

The IndexedDB implementation is specifically designed for mobile-first PWA requirements, optimizing for limited storage, intermittent connectivity, and touch-based interactions.

#### Storage Optimization Strategy

```typescript
// Mobile-optimized IndexedDB service
const initMobileDB = async () => {
  return openDB('ChecklistsDB', 1, {
    upgrade(db) {
      // Checklists store with mobile-optimized indexes
      const checklistStore = db.createObjectStore('checklists', {
        keyPath: 'id',
      })
      checklistStore.createIndex('date-department', ['date', 'department_id'])
      checklistStore.createIndex('status', 'status')

      // Tasks with touch-optimized query patterns
      const taskStore = db.createObjectStore('tasks', { keyPath: 'id' })
      taskStore.createIndex('checklist-order', ['checklist_id', 'order'])

      // Mobile-optimized sync queue
      const syncStore = db.createObjectStore('pending_syncs', {
        autoIncrement: true,
      })
      syncStore.createIndex('priority-timestamp', ['priority', 'timestamp'])

      // Compact metadata store for mobile
      const metaStore = db.createObjectStore('metadata', { keyPath: 'key' })
    },
  })
}
```

#### Mobile Storage Limits Management

```typescript
// Storage quota management for mobile devices
const manageStorageQuota = async () => {
  if ('storage' in navigator && 'estimate' in navigator.storage) {
    const estimate = await navigator.storage.estimate()
    const usagePercent = (estimate.usage / estimate.quota) * 100

    if (usagePercent > 80) {
      // Aggressive cleanup for mobile storage constraints
      await cleanupOldChecklists()
      await compressTaskData()
    }

    if (usagePercent > 95) {
      // Emergency cleanup - keep only current day data
      await emergencyStorageCleanup()
    }
  }
}
```

#### Data Compression for Mobile

```typescript
// Compress data for mobile storage efficiency
const saveChecklistOffline = async (checklist) => {
  const db = await initMobileDB()

  // Compress large text fields for mobile storage
  const compressedChecklist = {
    ...checklist,
    description: checklist.description
      ? await compressText(checklist.description)
      : null,
    tasks: checklist.tasks.map((task) => ({
      ...task,
      description: task.description ? compressText(task.description) : null,
    })),
  }

  await db.put('checklists', compressedChecklist)
}
```

### 11.2 Mobile-First Offline Queue Management

#### Touch-Optimized Conflict Resolution

```typescript
// Mobile-friendly conflict resolution UI
const ConflictResolutionModal = ({ conflicts, onResolve }) => {
  return (
    <MobileModal title="Sync Conflicts Detected">
      <div className="space-y-4">
        {conflicts.map(conflict => (
          <div key={conflict.id} className="bg-yellow-50 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <h4 className="font-medium mb-2">{conflict.item}</h4>
            <p className="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-3">{conflict.description}</p>

            <div className="grid grid-cols-1 gap-2">
              <TouchButton
                variant="primary"
                onClick={() => onResolve(conflict.id, 'keep_local')}
              >
                Keep My Changes
              </TouchButton>
              <TouchButton
                variant="secondary"
                onClick={() => onResolve(conflict.id, 'keep_server')}
              >
                Use Server Version
              </TouchButton>
            </div>
          </div>
        ))}
      </div>
    </MobileModal>
  );
};
```

#### Network-Aware Sync Strategy

```typescript
// Mobile-optimized sync with network awareness
const useMobileSync = () => {
  const [networkInfo, setNetworkInfo] = useState(null)

  useEffect(() => {
    // Monitor network conditions on mobile
    if ('connection' in navigator) {
      const updateNetworkInfo = () => {
        setNetworkInfo({
          effectiveType: navigator.connection.effectiveType,
          downlink: navigator.connection.downlink,
          saveData: navigator.connection.saveData,
        })
      }

      navigator.connection.addEventListener('change', updateNetworkInfo)
      updateNetworkInfo()
    }
  }, [])

  const shouldSyncNow = (priority) => {
    // Respect mobile data constraints
    if (networkInfo?.saveData && priority !== 'critical') {
      return false
    }

    // Adjust based on connection quality
    if (networkInfo?.effectiveType === 'slow-2g' && priority === 'low') {
      return false
    }

    return true
  }

  return { networkInfo, shouldSyncNow }
}
```

### 11.3 Battery-Aware Background Sync

#### Mobile Power Management

```typescript
// Battery-aware sync implementation
const useBatteryAwareSync = () => {
  const [batteryLevel, setBatteryLevel] = useState(100)
  const [isCharging, setIsCharging] = useState(false)

  useEffect(() => {
    const updateBatteryInfo = async () => {
      if ('getBattery' in navigator) {
        const battery = await navigator.getBattery()

        setBatteryLevel(Math.round(battery.level * 100))
        setIsCharging(battery.charging)

        battery.addEventListener('levelchange', () => {
          setBatteryLevel(Math.round(battery.level * 100))
        })

        battery.addEventListener('chargingchange', () => {
          setIsCharging(battery.charging)
        })
      }
    }

    updateBatteryInfo()
  }, [])

  const shouldLimitSync = () => {
    // Aggressive power saving on mobile
    return batteryLevel < 20 && !isCharging
  }

  return { batteryLevel, isCharging, shouldLimitSync }
}
```

#### Background Sync Registration

```typescript
// Service worker sync with mobile considerations
self.addEventListener('sync', async (event) => {
  if (event.tag === 'sync-checklists') {
    event.waitUntil(syncWithPowerManagement())
  }
})

const syncWithPowerManagement = async () => {
  const batteryInfo = await getBatteryInfo()
  const networkInfo = getNetworkInfo()

  // Mobile-first sync priorities
  const syncOptions = {
    batchSize: getBatchSize(networkInfo),
    timeout: getTimeout(networkInfo),
    retryDelay: getRetryDelay(batteryInfo),
    maxRetries: batteryInfo.level < 20 ? 3 : 5,
  }

  await performSync(syncOptions)
}
```

### 11.2 Offline Queue Management

Queue operations follow ACID principles to ensure data consistency. All queue operations are wrapped in transactions. Failed operations roll back completely, preventing partial state corruption.

Action types cover all state-changing operations users can perform offline. Each action type has specific conflict resolution strategies. Task completions use last-write-wins while checklist submissions merge all completed tasks.

Retry logic implements exponential backoff with jitter to prevent network congestion when multiple devices come online simultaneously. Maximum retry attempts are configurable per action type. Critical actions like checklist submissions have higher retry limits.

Queue processing order respects dependencies between actions. For example, checklist creation must sync before task completions for that checklist. The queue processor builds a dependency graph for optimal processing order.

Error handling distinguishes between temporary and permanent failures. Network errors trigger retries while validation errors mark actions as failed. Failed actions remain visible to users with options to retry or discard.

### 11.3 Background Sync Implementation

Service worker background sync ensures data synchronization even when the app isn't active. Registration happens automatically when offline actions are queued. The browser handles retry timing based on network conditions.

Sync strategies vary by data type and urgency. Critical updates like checklist completions sync immediately when possible. Less urgent data like analytics events batch for efficient synchronization.

Progress communication keeps users informed during long sync operations. The UI shows sync progress with estimated completion times. Users can cancel non-critical syncs if needed. Partial progress is preserved for resume capability.

Conflict resolution follows business rules for data consistency. When server state has changed during offline period, merge strategies preserve user intent while maintaining data integrity. Conflicts that require user intervention are flagged clearly.

Battery and network awareness prevents aggressive syncing on limited connections. Sync operations pause on low battery or metered connections. Users can override these protections for critical updates.

### 11.4 Offline User Experience

Offline detection provides immediate user feedback when connectivity is lost. The offline indicator appears prominently but not obtrusively. It includes information about what functionality remains available offline.

Feature availability in offline mode is clearly communicated. Most checklist operations work offline, but certain features like real-time progress monitoring are disabled. The UI adapts to show only available features.

Data freshness indicators show when cached data was last updated. Stale data is marked visually with options to attempt refresh. Users understand whether they're working with current or cached information.

Sync status communication provides detailed feedback during synchronization. Users see which items are syncing, progress percentages, and any errors. The UI remains responsive during sync operations.

Offline-first design ensures the app feels fast regardless of connection quality. All reads come from IndexedDB with background network fetches. This provides instant response times with eventual consistency.

## 12. Security Considerations

### 12.1 Authentication Security

Staff number validation implements multiple security layers. Input sanitization prevents SQL injection attempts. Rate limiting blocks brute force attacks. Validation occurs server-side to prevent client bypass.

Session management uses secure token handling with appropriate expiration times. Tokens rotate on each authentication to prevent session fixation. Refresh tokens have longer expiration but are revoked on suspicious activity.

Device fingerprinting adds an additional security layer by tracking device characteristics. Unusual device changes trigger re-authentication. Users can view and manage recognized devices from account settings.

Account lockout policies balance security with user convenience. Failed login attempts trigger progressive delays. Complete lockout requires administrator intervention. Lockout events generate security alerts.

Password-less authentication eliminates common password vulnerabilities while maintaining security through system-generated credentials invisible to users. This approach prevents password sharing and phishing attacks.

### 12.2 Data Security

HTTPS enforcement ensures all data transmission is encrypted. The application refuses to load over insecure connections. Certificate pinning in the PWA prevents man-in-the-middle attacks.

Input sanitization occurs at multiple levels. Client-side validation provides immediate feedback while server-side validation ensures security. All user inputs are parameterized to prevent injection attacks.

XSS prevention uses Content Security Policy headers and React's built-in escaping. User-generated content is sanitized before storage and display. Third-party content is loaded in sandboxed iframes when necessary.

API security implements multiple protection layers. All endpoints require authentication. Rate limiting prevents abuse. Input validation rejects malformed requests. Sensitive operations require additional authorization checks.

Data encryption at rest protects sensitive information in the database. Personally identifiable information is encrypted using industry-standard algorithms. Encryption keys are rotated regularly and stored separately from data.

### 12.3 Role-Based Access Control

RLS policies enforce data access at the database level. Users cannot bypass application logic to access unauthorized data. Policies are tested extensively and reviewed regularly for gaps.

Permission checks occur at multiple application layers. Frontend routing prevents navigation to unauthorized areas. API endpoints verify permissions before processing. Database policies provide final enforcement.

Audit logging captures all security-relevant events. Login attempts, permission changes, and data access are logged with sufficient detail for investigation. Logs are immutable and retained according to compliance requirements.

Privilege escalation prevention ensures users cannot grant themselves additional permissions. Role assignments require appropriate authorization. All permission changes are logged and can be reverted if necessary.

Security testing includes penetration testing, vulnerability scanning, and security code reviews. Automated tools check for common vulnerabilities. Manual testing verifies business logic security.

### 12.4 Privacy Protection

Data minimization principles guide what information is collected and retained. Only essential data for business operations is stored. Personal information is purged according to retention policies.

User consent is obtained for data collection and processing. Privacy policies are clear and accessible. Users can request their data or deletion through self-service tools where possible.

Third-party integrations are vetted for privacy compliance. Data sharing agreements specify how shared data can be used. Regular audits ensure compliance with agreements.

Anonymization techniques protect user privacy in analytics and reporting. Individual user actions are aggregated. Reports show trends without identifying specific users unless required for operations.

GDPR compliance includes right to access, right to deletion, and data portability. Automated tools handle common requests. Complex requests are routed to privacy officers for handling.

---

## 13. Performance Optimization

### 13.1 Loading Performance

Initial load optimization focuses on critical rendering path optimization. The app shell loads first with minimal CSS and JavaScript. Content loads progressively as needed. Above-the-fold content is prioritized.

Code splitting breaks the application into logical chunks. Routes are lazy-loaded on demand. Large libraries are loaded only when features requiring them are accessed. Common code is extracted into shared chunks.

Bundle size optimization uses tree shaking to eliminate dead code. Production builds are minified and compressed. Source maps are generated separately for debugging. Modern JavaScript syntax reduces bundle size.

Asset optimization includes image compression, WebP format for supporting browsers, and responsive images for different screen sizes. Icons use SVG format where possible for scalability and small size.

Preloading and prefetching improve perceived performance. Critical resources are preloaded. Likely next navigations are prefetched during idle time. Service worker precaching ensures instant subsequent loads.

### 13.2 Runtime Performance

React optimization techniques prevent unnecessary renders. Components use React.memo where appropriate. Callbacks are memoized with useCallback. Expensive computations are memoized with useMemo.

Virtual scrolling handles long lists efficiently. Only visible items render with buffer for smooth scrolling. Recycled components reduce memory usage. Scroll position restoration maintains user context.

State update batching reduces render cycles. Related state updates are grouped. Asynchronous updates are coordinated. React 18's automatic batching improves performance by default.

Memory management prevents leaks in long-running sessions. Event listeners are cleaned up properly. Subscriptions are unsubscribed on unmount. Large data structures are garbage collected when no longer needed.

Animation performance uses CSS transforms and opacity for smooth 60fps animations. JavaScript animations use requestAnimationFrame. Complex animations are GPU-accelerated where possible.

### 13.3 Network Optimization

Request batching combines multiple API calls into single requests where possible. GraphQL or custom endpoints provide exactly needed data. Over-fetching is minimized through careful API design.

Response caching reduces redundant network requests. Cache headers are set appropriately for different resource types. Conditional requests use ETags for efficient cache validation.

Compression reduces data transfer sizes. Gzip or Brotli compression is enabled for text resources. API responses use efficient formats like MessagePack for binary data.

CDN usage distributes static assets globally for faster delivery. Edge locations serve resources from geographically close servers. Dynamic content uses regional edge functions where beneficial.

Progressive data loading provides immediate value while loading additional data. Essential data loads first with enhanced data following. Users can interact with partial data while complete data loads.

### 13.4 Monitoring and Analytics

Performance monitoring tracks key metrics continuously. Core Web Vitals are measured for real user sessions. Performance budgets alert when metrics degrade. Synthetic monitoring provides consistent baselines.

Error tracking captures and categorizes application errors. Stack traces are sourcemapped for debugging. Error rates are monitored with alerts for spikes. User impact is assessed for prioritization.

User analytics track feature usage and user journeys. Privacy-respecting analytics provide insights without compromising user privacy. A/B testing validates performance improvements.

Real-time dashboards show system health at a glance. Key metrics are visualized with appropriate time ranges. Anomaly detection alerts on unusual patterns. Historical data enables trend analysis.

Performance optimization is an ongoing process based on real user data. Regular performance audits identify improvement opportunities. Improvements are measured and validated before full rollout.

  it('should handle optimistic updates correctly', async () => {
    const { result } = renderHook(() => useChecklistStore())

    act(() => {
      result.current.completeTask('task-1')
    })

    // Verify optimistic update
    expect(result.current.tasks.find((t) => t.id === 'task-1')?.completed).toBe(
      true,
    )

    // Verify state rollback on sync failure
    act(() => {
      result.current.handleSyncError('task-1')
    })

    expect(result.current.tasks.find((t) => t.id === 'task-1')?.completed).toBe(
      false,
    )
  })
})
```

### 14.2 Component Testing with Storybook 8.x (✅ Implemented)

#### Modern Storybook Configuration

## 15. Deployment & DevOps

### 15.1 Build Pipeline

The build process is fully automated and reproducible. Every commit triggers a build that follows the same steps, ensuring consistency across environments. Build artifacts are versioned and stored for rollback capability.

TypeScript compilation includes strict type checking with no implicit any allowed. Build fails on type errors. Source maps are generated for production debugging. Declaration files support library consumers.

Linting enforces code quality standards across the codebase. ESLint configuration includes React-specific rules. Prettier ensures consistent formatting. Pre-commit hooks prevent committing non-compliant code.

Bundle optimization produces minimal production builds. Tree shaking removes unused code. Minification reduces file sizes. Compression further reduces transfer sizes. Critical CSS is inlined for performance.

Build verification includes automated smoke tests. Built application is started and critical paths verified. Lighthouse CI checks performance metrics. Bundle size analysis prevents regression.

### 15.2 Deployment Strategy

Environment progression follows development, staging, and production stages. Each environment has identical infrastructure with different scales. Configuration differences are minimal and well-documented.

Blue-green deployment enables zero-downtime updates. New version deploys to inactive environment. After verification, traffic switches instantly. Previous version remains available for instant rollback.

Feature flags allow gradual feature rollout. New features can be enabled for specific users or percentages. A/B testing is supported through the same infrastructure. Flags are cleaned up after full rollout.

Database migrations run automatically before deployment. Migrations are reversible where possible. Breaking changes are handled through multi-phase deployments. Data integrity is verified post-migration.

CDN cache invalidation ensures users receive updates promptly. Critical resources are invalidated immediately. Less critical resources use shorter cache times. Service worker updates handle client-side caching.

### 15.3 Monitoring and Observability

Application monitoring covers all critical user journeys. Synthetic monitors run key scenarios continuously. Real user monitoring captures actual user experience. Alerts notify on degradation.

Infrastructure monitoring tracks server resources, database performance, and network health. Metrics are collected at high granularity. Dashboards provide at-a-glance system health. Capacity planning uses historical data.

Log aggregation centralizes logs from all services. Structured logging enables efficient searching. Log retention balances compliance needs with storage costs. Sensitive data is excluded from logs.

Error tracking provides detailed debugging information. Errors are grouped by similarity. Impact is assessed by affected users. Integration with issue tracking streamlines fixes.

Business metrics track checklist completion rates, user engagement, and system usage. Custom dashboards serve different stakeholder needs. Reports are automated for regular distribution.

### 15.4 Incident Response

Incident detection uses automated monitoring and alerting. Multiple signals are correlated to reduce false positives. Severity levels determine response requirements. Escalation paths are clearly defined.

Response procedures are documented and regularly practiced. Runbooks provide step-by-step resolution guides. Communication templates ensure consistent stakeholder updates. Post-mortems identify improvement opportunities.

Recovery procedures prioritize business continuity. Rollback procedures are tested regularly. Data recovery procedures handle various failure scenarios. Communication plans keep users informed during incidents.

Prevention measures address root causes identified in post-mortems. Chaos engineering validates system resilience. Game days simulate incidents for practice. Improvements are tracked and validated.

Compliance documentation demonstrates adherence to requirements. Audit trails prove proper procedures were followed. Regular reviews ensure procedures remain current. Training ensures team readiness.
